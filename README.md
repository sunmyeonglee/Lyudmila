# Lyudmila
'Journey To Lyudmila' is a python game developed by @vivianlee03.

### Description
1. Lyudmila is a planet featured in the short story "Symbiotic Hypothesis" from Kim Choyeop's novel, "If We Cannot Travel at the Speed of Light." This planet is described as the original homeland of all humans and is depicted in a highly surreal and beautiful manner. Inspired by the textual description of this planet, I aim to create an imagery-based game.
2. In the novel, Lyudmila possesses the following characteristics: in violet to blue hues, mostly covered by seas, and inhabited by luminous life forms. I intend to incorporate these settings into the game by creating backgrounds, items, and characters.
3. I have chosen the basic structure of a platform jumping game and plan to make various modifications. In a platform jumping game, the character jumps to ascend without colliding with obstacles to earn points.
4. In my game, there won't be a single static background. As the score increases, the background will change from the deep sea to land and then to the sky. The player, controlling the character, will explore the world of Lyudmila. Upon encountering Lyudmila, the planetary owner, amidst the clouds, the player will receive a message and have the opportunity to clear the game.
